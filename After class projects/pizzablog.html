    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <p>Pizza[a] is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In 2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In 2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]

Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants, including pizzerias, Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked using a home oven.

In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion; in the US, it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[12] Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[13] Furthermore, pizza is the most eaten food in the world after rice, followed by pasta.[14]</p>
